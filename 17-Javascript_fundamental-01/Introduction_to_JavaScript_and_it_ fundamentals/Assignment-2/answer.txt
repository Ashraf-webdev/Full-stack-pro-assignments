Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you would use each.

Ans: JavaScript and HTML are both important for building web pages, but they serve different purposes:

HTML:

     1. Structure: HTML is like the blueprint of a web page. It defines the structure and layout of the content.

     Example: We use HTML to create headings, paragraphs, lists, and organize the content on a webpage. For instance, `<h1>` for
     the main title, <p> for paragraphs, and <ul> for an unordered list.

     2. Static Content: HTML is mainly for displaying fixed information that doesn't change unless the page is reloaded.

     Example: An "About Us" page on a website, where the content remains the same until someone updates it.


JavaScript:

     1. Interactivity: JavaScript adds life to your web page. It allows you to create interactive features and respond to user actions.

     Example: When we click a button to open a pop-up or a menu, or when we fill out a form, and it checks if email address is correct,
     that's JavaScript at work.

     2. Dynamic Content: JavaScript can update parts of a webpage without reloading the entire page. It's perfect for displaying changing
     information, like real-time updates.

     Example: Social media feeds that automatically refresh with new posts without you having to refresh the whole page are powered by JavaScript.

     3. Third-Party Integration: JavaScript connects web page to external services or APIs, such as Google Maps or weather updates.

In simple terms, think of HTML as the structure and static content of a web page, like the frame of a house, while JavaScript is like the electricity
and plumbing, making it interactive, dynamic, and connected to the outside world. We use HTML to create the page's basic structure, and we use JavaScript
to make it come alive with interactive features and real-time updates.
