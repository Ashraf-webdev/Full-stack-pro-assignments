Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multi-line comments.

Ans: Comments in JavaScript are essential for writing clear and understandable code. They serve several important purposes, such as
explaining your code, making it more maintainable, and aiding collaboration with other developers. Here's the importance of comments
and examples of single-line and multi-line comments:

  1. Code Explanation: 
  *  Comments help you explain the purpose of your code. They provide context to what your code is doing, making it
     easier for you and others to understand.
  *  Comments can be used to document complex algorithms, functions, or tricky logic, making it clear why certain decisions were made.

  2. Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily "disable" a piece of code for debugging purposes, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

  3. Collaboration: Comments enhance collaboration between team members. They provide insights into your code, making it easier for others
     to work with or build upon what you've written.
