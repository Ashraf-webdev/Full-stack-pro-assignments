2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.

Ans: Operators in JavaScript are categorized based on their functionality into several groups, each designed for specific purposes.

Here are the main categories of operators:

  1. Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical calculations.
  
  2. Comparison Operators: Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false) result.

  3. Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values.

  4. Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

  5. Unary Operators: Unary operators work with a single operand and perform various operations.

  6. Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is a short way to write simple conditional statements.

  7. Bitwise Operators: Bitwise operators manipulate the binary representation of numbers.


These operator categories are the building blocks of JavaScript, allowing you to perform a wide range of operations and control flow within your code.

NOTE: "Example of each category are contained within the code file."
