3. Define accessibility in the context of web development. Discuss why itâ€™s essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits different user groups. 


Ans: Accessibility in the context of web development refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that
     ensures they can be used and understood by as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities, disabilities, or the technology they are using.

     There are some reasons why creating accessible websites is essential and how it benefits different user groups:	

     1. Improved User Experience: Accessibility features often enhance the overall user experience for all users. For example, captions on videos benefit
        not only the deaf and hard of hearing but also people in noisy environments or those who prefer to watch videos without sound.
     2. Expanded Audience: Accessible websites reach a broader audience, potentially increasing your website's user base. People with disabilities are a
        significant and diverse demographic group, and their needs should not be overlooked.
     3. SEO Benefits: Search engines value accessibility. Well-structured, accessible websites tend to rank better in search results. Proper use of 
        semantic HTML and alternative text for images can improve SEO.
     4. Inclusivity: Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use the web. This includes people with disabilities
        such as visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments, as well as the elderly and those with temporary impairments.
