Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.


Ans: A conditional statement in programming is a construct that allows a program to make decisions based on whether
     a specified condition evaluates to true or false. It enables the execution of different code blocks depending on
     the outcome of the condition. In JavaScript, a conditional statement is a control flow structure that facilitates
     decision-making in a program. Using constructs such as if, else, and else if, JavaScript programmers can direct the
     flow of execution based on logical conditions. 


Syntax: 

If (condition) {
   
    // Code to execute if the condition is true 

} else {

     // Code to execute if the condition is false

}
