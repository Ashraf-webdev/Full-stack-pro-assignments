Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Ans: In JavaScript, a loop serves as a repetition mechanism, enabling the program to iterate over a block of code
     multiple times until a specified condition is met or a certain number of iterations is reached. Loops contribute
     to code efficiency by eliminating the need to manually write repetitive code. They offer a concise way to handle
     repeated tasks, making programs more maintainable and less prone to errors.

     There are mainly three types of loops in JavaScript:

     1. for loop

     Syntax: 
     
     for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
         
         // Code to be repeated    

     }
     
     2. while loop

     Syntax: 
     
     while (condition) {
         
         // Code to be repeated    

     }

     3. do-while loop

     Syntax: 
     
     do {
         
         // Code to be repeated    

     } while (conditon);
