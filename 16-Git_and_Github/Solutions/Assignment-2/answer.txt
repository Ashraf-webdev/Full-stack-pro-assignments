Q2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository?

Ans: The Git Workflow involves three key components: the working directery, sataging area and repository.
  
     1. Working Directory: Working directory is your local project folder. This is where you create, edit, and delete files in your project.
        Think of it as your local playground. It's where you make changes, add new features, and fix bugs. When you're satisfied with the changes,
        you decide which ones you want to keep.

     2. Staging Area:  The staging area is like a checkpoint before saving your changes permanently. Here, you choose which modifications should be
        included in the next snapshot of your project's history (commit). It's as if you're putting specific items on a to-do list, saying, "I'm ready
        to commit these changes."

     3. Repository: This is where all your committed snapshots are stored, forming a complete history of your project. Think of it as an album containing
        all the photos you've taken of your playground over time. It keeps track of your project's changes, making it possible to revisit any snapshot to 
        see what your project looked like at that moment.
