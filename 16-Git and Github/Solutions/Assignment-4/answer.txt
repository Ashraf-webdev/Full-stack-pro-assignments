Q4. Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some 
    alternatives to GitHub.


Ans: GitHub is like a shared playground for software developers. It's a website where they store, collaborate on, and track
     changes in their code. It's the place where they work together on building software projects, just like friends playing together
     on a playground.
     
     GitHub is a platform for storing, managing, and collaborating on code. Here's how it works:

     1. Repository Creation: Users create a "repository," which is like a folder for their project. This repository can hold code,
        files, and more.
     2. Version Control: GitHub tracks changes in the code. It's like taking pictures of the project at different stages. If something
        breaks, users can go back to a working "photo" (commit).
     3. Collaboration: Multiple users can work on the same project. They can see what others are doing and make changes. It's like friends
        working together on a project.
     4. Pull Requests: Users suggest changes to the project. It's like asking for permission to make changes to a shared project.
     5. Code Hosting: GitHub also hosts code in the cloud. This means the code is safe and can be accessed from anywhere.


     Key Features of GitHub:

     1. Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project, making it great for team projects.
     2. Version Control: It tracks changes and lets you go back to a previous state if something goes wrong.
     3. Community: GitHub has a large community of developers who share and collaborate on projects.
     4. Visibility Control: You can choose to make your code public or private.

     Alternatives to GitHub:

     1. GitLab: Similar to GitHub, it offers a place for storing and collaborating on code.
     2. Bitbucket: It's another platform for code hosting and collaboration.
     3. SourceForge: An older platform that's still used for open-source projects.
     4. GitKraken: A graphical user interface (GUI) for Git that simplifies version control.
