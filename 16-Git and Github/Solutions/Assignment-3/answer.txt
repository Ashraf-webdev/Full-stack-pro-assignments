Q3. Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control?

Ans: .gitignore is like a "do not include" list for files in your project. It tells Git what files or directories to ignore or skip when
      you're tracking changes in your version control system.


     Here's why the .gitignore file is important in Version control:
     
     1. Reducing Clutter: .gitignore prevents unimportant files from cluttering your version control history, making it easier to
        focus on what matters.

     2. Security: It keeps sensitive data like passwords and API keys out of version control, protecting your project's security.

     3. Efficiency: By ignoring temporary or build files, your Git operations become faster and more efficient.

     4. Collaboration: It ensures that collaborators don't accidentally commit irrelevant files, improving teamwork.

     5. Consistency: .gitignore helps maintain a clean, consistent project structure by excluding unnecessary files and directories.
