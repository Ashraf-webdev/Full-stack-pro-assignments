Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.


Ans: In JavaScript, operators are categorized into unary, binary, and ternary operators based on the number of operands they work with:

  1. Unary Operators:

  Functionality: Unary operators work with a single operand, meaning they operate on a single value. They can perform various operations
  on that one value.

  2. Binary Operators:

  Functionality: Binary operators require two operands, one on the left and one on the right, to perform an operation that combines or
  compares these two values.

  3. Ternary Operator:

  Functionality: The ternary operator is unique in that it's the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It's used for
  creating conditional expressions that result in one of two values based on a condition.
