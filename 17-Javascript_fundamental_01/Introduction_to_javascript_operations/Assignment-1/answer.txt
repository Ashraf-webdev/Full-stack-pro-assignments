Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?

Ans: Operators in JavaScript are essential elements of programming that enable you to perform various operations on data,
variables, and values. They play a pivotal role in manipulating, comparing, and combining data in meaningful ways, allowing
you to build complex logic and make your code functional and dynamic. 

Here's why operators are essential in programming:

  1. Data Manipulation: Operators allow you to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   This is fundamental for working with numbers, which are a core component of many programs.

  2. Comparison: Comparison operators help you evaluate conditions by comparing values. This is crucial for decision-making in code,
     such as determining whether to execute a certain block of code based on conditions.

  3. Logical Operations: Logical operators like && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT) are essential for creating complex
     conditions and controlling the flow of your code. They enable you to build if statements, loops, and other control structures.

  4. Increment and Decrement: Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.
     They are essential for loop constructs and other situations where you need to modify a variable's value.

  5. String Concatenation: JavaScript provides operators for combining strings, making it easier to build dynamic text and messages in
     your applications.

In summary, operators in JavaScript are the building blocks of programming that empower you to perform a wide range of operations on data.
