Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where
using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Ans: Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintainability. Clear
and well-chosen variable names make it easier for you and other developers to understand the purpose and usage of the variables
in your code. 

Here's the importance of using meaningful variable names and an example how it improves code readability:

  1. Understanding Code Intent:
     Descriptive variable names provide context, helping you and others understand the purpose and role of each variable in your code.

  2. Self-Documenting Code:
     Well-chosen variable names act as self-documentation, reducing the need for extensive comments. They make the code more understandable
     at a glance.

  3. Debugging and Maintenance:
     When you revisit your code or when other developers work with it, clear variable names reduce the chances of misinterpretation and make
     debugging and maintenance tasks smoother.

  4. Future Maintenance:
     As your code evolves over time, meaningful variable names help you or future developers maintain and extend the codebase with confidence.


In conclusion, meaningful and descriptive variable names are not just a matter of good practice; they significantly improve code readability,
understanding, and the overall quality of JavaScript code.
