Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the "let" keyword?

Ans: Declaring variables in JavaScript serves a crucial role in programming. It allows to reserve memory space to store and manipulate
data within code. By declaring variables, we give names to values, making code more readable and maintainable. It also enables you to reuse
and update values easily throughout program. JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables, and one of the most commonly used methods is
with the "let" keyword.

Here's how we declare a variable using the "let" keyword:

   let name = "Ashraf";
   let age = 20;


By declaring variables with "let" in a clear and controlled manner, we improve code organization and prevent common pitfalls. This makes JavaScript
code more reliable and maintainable, contributing to the overall quality of our software.
