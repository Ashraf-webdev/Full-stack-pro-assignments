Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

Ans: JavaScript is like the brain of a website. It's a special language that web developers use to make websites smarter and more interactive.
          Imagine a website as a book with text and pictures (that's the HTML and CSS). JavaScript is like the hidden wizard who adds magic to the book:

          1.Interaction: With JavaScript, developers can create buttons, forms, and other elements that you can click on or interact with. It's like making
            the pictures in the book move or respond when you touch them.

          2. Up-to-Date Content: We have seen websites that update without refreshing the whole page. JavaScript is the spell that does that. It can bring
             in new information, like the latest news or social media posts, without you having to start over.

          3. Error Checking: When we fill out a form on a website, like when we register for something or buy a product, JavaScript can make sure we're doing it
             correctly. It's like a friendly guide who helps you avoid mistakes.

          4. Animations: JavaScript can also make things on the website move and change in cool ways, like sliding menus or fading images. It's like adding a bit
             of magic to the pictures in the book, making them come to life.

          5. Connecting to the World: Sometimes websites need to talk to other services, like maps or social media. JavaScript is the messenger that makes this 
             happen, so the website can do more things.

In simple terms, JavaScript is the behind-the-scenes wizard that makes websites more interesting, interactive, and helpful. It turns them from static pages into
dynamic, engaging experiences.
