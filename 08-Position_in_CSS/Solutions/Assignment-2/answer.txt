Q2. Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.


Solutions: Relative Positioning:
           - Relative positioning means an element is positioned relative to its normal position on the web page.
           - If you move an element with relative positioning, it will still affect the layout of other elements around it.  
           - Imagine pushing a box on a table. The box will stay on the table, and other objects will make room for it 
             as you push it around.
           - It's like moving an object on a table while other objects on the table adjust around it.
           - Elements stay in their normal spots, and the moved element doesn't float in space. 

          Absolute Positioning:
          - Absolute positioning means an element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no 
            ancestor is positioned, it's positioned relative to the whole page.
          - When you move an element with absolute positioning, it's taken out of the normal flow of the page, and other
            elements don't make room for it. It's like lifting a sticker off a piece of paper; the sticker doesn't affect
            other parts of the paper.
          - Elements with absolute positioning can overlap with other elements on the page.
          - It's like lifting a sticker off a piece of paper and putting it anywhere you want.
          - Elements don't make space for it, and it can overlap with other things on the page.
