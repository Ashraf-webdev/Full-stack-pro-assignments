Ans: We have a grid container with a 3x2 grid structure defined using grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. This means there are 3 columns and 2 rows.
     grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns are used to set the default height and width for rows and columns created automatically within the grid. In this case,
     both are set to 100px.

     So, in this example, if you add more items to the grid container, they will automatically create new rows and columns with a height and width of 100px, 
     maintaining a consistent layout.
