Ans: justify-items: It is a property that sets the alignment of all grid items within a grid container along the horizontal (main) axis.
     It affects all the items inside the grid equally.

     justify-self: It is a property that sets the horizontal (main) axis alignment of an individual grid item within a grid container.
     It allows you to control the alignment of specific grid items differently.


Code Example explaination: When using justify-items, all items in the grid container are center-aligned within their respective cells.
                           When using justify-self on an individual item, only that specific item is right-aligned within its cell. The other
                           items remain center-aligned due to the justify-items property applied to the container.

So, justify-items affects all items uniformly within the grid container, while justify-self allows you to control the alignment of individual items differently.
