Q1.Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is
even or odd using the ternary operator?

Ans: The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write conditional expressions
     in JavaScript. It allows to make decisions and choose one of two values or expressions based on a condition.

     Usage of ternary operator:

     1. Assigning Values Based on a Condition
     2. Returning Values from a Function
     3. Changing a Variable's Value Based on a Condition
     4. Displaying Different Text in HTML:

     The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

     condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

     Condition: A Boolean expression that is evaluated. If it's true, the expression returns valueIfTrue; if it's false,
     it returns valueIfFalse.

     valueIfTrue: The value or expression to be returned if the condition is true.

     valueIfFalse: The value or expression to be returned if the condition is false.
