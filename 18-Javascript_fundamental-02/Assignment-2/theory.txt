Q2.Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

Ans:The comma operator in JavaScript allows you to combine multiple expressions into a single expression,
    evaluating them from left to right. It's often used in situations where you need to perform multiple operations
    within a single statement.

    The comma operator is most commonly used in for loops and compact variable assignments, where multiple expressions
    need to be executed sequentially within a single statement. It's a powerful tool for streamlining code while maintaining
    readability.

   Here's are the usage of comma operator in Javascript:

   1. Compact Variable Declaration and Assignment
   2. Loop Control with Multiple Expressions
   3. In a while Loop
   4. Compact Array Initialization
   5. Multiple Function Arguments
